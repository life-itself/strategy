# A history of projects to work *on* strategy

- Jun 2024-üîÅ (ongoing) - Strategy review and planning üöß
  - This has somehow metamorphised a bit. Started out as a sync of Rufus & Sylvie and has grown into another strategy evolution.
  - Task: ‚ùå (TODO)
  - Shaping: missing ...
- Jan 2024-‚è∏Ô∏è - Presenting our strategy (as is) üöß‚è∏Ô∏è status: produced this KB and put most materials and never got to evaluation and publication
  - Summary (from task derived from shaping)
    - Appetite: 3d (reduced by 1d given we spent 1.5d in shaping and work we did in shaping will help)
    - Problem: lot of strategy-related materials but they aren't woven together or consolidated which creates a sense of overwhelm and confusion and prevents them being published and used.
    - Solution: inventory materials, create framework to organize them, create roadmap for publication. If we can, start on consolidated strategy.
  - Task: https://github.com/life-itself/community/issues/1048
  - Pitch: https://github.com/life-itself/comms/blob/main/pitch/2401%20Presenting%20our%20Strategy%20v3%20in%20its%20current%20form.md
- Sep 2021 - Updated and consolidated Core SCQH / logic of existence / theory of change including summary "why Life Itself" - Sep 2021
  - Task: https://github.com/life-itself/community/issues/36
  - Currently we have a large amount of material spread in many areas. We would like a consolidated structure for our SCQHs and at least one root SCQH plus a consolidated summary version so that:
    - We have a clear, simple and short summary for e.g. our front page, for communication
    - We have a organizing structure for our work i.e. any given activity should now be mappable against that hypothesis tree / theory of change
- Nov 2022 (opened) `[uber][epic]` LI v3 Strategy & Implementation 
  - This was the overall task item for doing the v3 strategy
  - Task: https://github.com/life-itself/community/issues/196
    - A10: pretty minimal https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lxWWI4IvnWPLPtQjLY2_fGkko99MnqIDKMCD6E-uDaQ/edit#heading=h.3vdu4snhplyo (could merge to issue)
