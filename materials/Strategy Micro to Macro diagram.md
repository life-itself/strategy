## Notes

- A diagram with little explanatory text
  - Explains our basic logic of *how* a paradigm happens and our role (LI vision and high-level ToC)
- The source excalidraw includes more material e.g. an extended version that adds research work
  - Turning into a slide show with notes??
  - Short script?
