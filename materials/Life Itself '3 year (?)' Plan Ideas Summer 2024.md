Life Itself '3 year (?)' Plan - Summer 2024 - Initial draft by Rufus & Sylvie.

An initial sketch with quite a bit of detail on individual streams/programs.

Motivated broader inquiry into strategy and production of new and final strategy v3 and from that new workstreams.

Still has a few useful items e.g. description of vision for [[Art of Second Renaissance]].
