## Summary

1. Aim: paradigmatic civilisational transition - a "second renaissance and the birth of an awakening society"
2. How do such transitions come about? (We are relatively early still...)
3. How do we support this transition? (atm)
  - Create "pockets of a second renaissance"
  - Build a "movement for a second renaissance"
4. To support that...
  -  Hubs
  - Greenhouse
  - Lighthouse
