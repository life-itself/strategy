- **Macro level** ("what we are truly up to"): "creating a self-sustaining culture of socially-engaged awakening..."
	- Extracted primarily from [[Community Day 2020]]
+ **How**: sustained involvement in “sangha”, hence need for Kibbuddhism
+ **Meso level** (flywheel model): become a facilitator of “Intentional Teal Neighbourhoods” and “Purposful Teal Businesses”
+ **Micro level** ("where we are right now"): "focused on the “entry point” labeled “Initiatives and Offerings that inform & attract people""
