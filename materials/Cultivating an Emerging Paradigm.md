Notes

- Stuff that could be extracted
  - the principles are useful stand-alone
  - issue tree
- What's missing / could be added
  - More detail on the hypothesis and a hypothesis tree
- Raw version has some more appendix material we never got round to including, in particular, some detail on our hypothesis for the stages of emergence of a new onto-social paradigm.
