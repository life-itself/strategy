This was a list of materials related to strategy created in Oct 2021. Named "Why we exist content list". It was part of [[SCQH for v3 strategy - why do the revision]]. Originally in this sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x4czK3jC7-QopHoGma_VcRgaXuUyDDa118m18l__d8M/edit#gid=0 we have inlined it here and deleted original sheet.

Status = roughly how polished / finished this doc was.

| Doc | Link | Status (1-5) | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| SCQHs (2019 and 'transforming societies') | [https://tao.lifeitself.us/scqh/#complication](https://tao.lifeitself.us/scqh/#complication) | 5 | Last all team produced overall SCQH from which the overall issue/hyp trees should folow, and the 'transforming the narrative' SCQH from which the big vision ToC should flow. |
| Big Vision ToC | [https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1shYHaBKESJjMv0a_zG3-RDksmFCkaZ5XpcLv9ZFX4eQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1shYHaBKESJjMv0a_zG3-RDksmFCkaZ5XpcLv9ZFX4eQ/edit?usp=sharing) | 5 (v1) | One of the two 'pillars' of our work (at least up until now) by which we hope to attain our overall objective. Essentually a causal breakdown of one half of our overall hypothesis along with pioneering a culture (although this role may change given our pivot) |
| Pioneering Culture ToC | [https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1w8vmlbIaRlA766WJrSDxq-Zsmyrliw0wpAcZKXY18HE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1w8vmlbIaRlA766WJrSDxq-Zsmyrliw0wpAcZKXY18HE/edit?usp=sharing) | 5 (v1) | As above |
| Overall issue/hypothesis tree | [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z27C3MvAQi0fhi4MgGK3WB5ukldBBAmABoWdSFr4pGU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z27C3MvAQi0fhi4MgGK3WB5ukldBBAmABoWdSFr4pGU/edit?usp=sharing) | 4 | Comes out of the overall SCQH to break down question and hypothesis further. Note this from an old SCQH so may not be directly applicable to the updated one we're working on. |
| 2018 notes on reason for our existence | [https://docs.google.com/document/d/19jiJ8QtTLdu_pCkwBH1OGKExvcf2C0ob3bGpVmW3Yy4/edit#heading=h.t2ksjporgzbm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19jiJ8QtTLdu_pCkwBH1OGKExvcf2C0ob3bGpVmW3Yy4/edit#heading=h.t2ksjporgzbm) | 2 | Foundaitonal thinking to an SCQH |
| Document registry from 2019 | [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k9Xn52IOI07fqcZj0wFtvzAKn0xDyDXBmcACL2IEkTg/edit#gid=2133919019](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k9Xn52IOI07fqcZj0wFtvzAKn0xDyDXBmcACL2IEkTg/edit#gid=2133919019) | 4 (but maybe outdated) | Contains a number of docs (esp across core and supporting) which would support or feed into an SCQH (but all quite old |
| Narrative | [https://tao.lifeitself.us/narrative/#what-makes-us-different](https://tao.lifeitself.us/narrative/#what-makes-us-different) | 5 | Should inform or add colour to SCQH |
| SCQH - social transformation in communities | [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mo0bb0AOz2lq3pTUofuiLF1mfy5fYv9vXeNTprFtso/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mo0bb0AOz2lq3pTUofuiLF1mfy5fYv9vXeNTprFtso/edit) | 5 | Specific to this project, but should overlap and cohere with broader pioneering a culture SCQH.  <br>  <br>Rufus 2024-02-13 i don't think this is relevant at all. This looks like a practice SCQH by someone e.g. Theo. |
| SCQH - wiser world research programme | [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18KaR0xlb1MZ0nArHDwAoApFtQZer1hy_1ce5j2YEVbQ/edit#heading=h.rikmbbt8nz7p](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18KaR0xlb1MZ0nArHDwAoApFtQZer1hy_1ce5j2YEVbQ/edit#heading=h.rikmbbt8nz7p) | 5 | Specific to this project, but should overlap and cohere with broader transforming the narrative SCQH |
| SCQH - Untitled narrative | [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lYRtKwAsDh8WwKlC141nsI5ZMeZxjPtbqRP8eEpqi0Y/edit#heading=h.nfqwk218fui3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lYRtKwAsDh8WwKlC141nsI5ZMeZxjPtbqRP8eEpqi0Y/edit#heading=h.nfqwk218fui3) | 5 | Specific to this project, but should overlap and cohere with broader transforming the narrative SCQH |
| Bjorkman SCQH | [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ypEZMLnh3xaR8uf6WtfTNKYFd2JW_748QBDhpjKPlAo/edit#heading=h.ukbksiv6mbo0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ypEZMLnh3xaR8uf6WtfTNKYFd2JW_748QBDhpjKPlAo/edit#heading=h.ukbksiv6mbo0) | 5 | Specific to this project, but should overlap and cohere with broader pioneering a culture SCQH and our new, post-pivot overall SCQH |
