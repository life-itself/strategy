## Notes

Summary
- **Situation** – post-2020: strategy was starting Hubs + catalysing big vision conversations
- **Complication** – too high level in our brand and our offer and not specific enough in our audience (i.e. in both call to actions and especially in topics) and hubs not working (partly as a result of that, partly because hard and too early)
- **Question** – What is our new strategy?
- **Hypothesis**
  - High-level strategy largely unchanged from [[Overall SCQH 2021]]
  - Meso/micro-level strategy got significantly updated, as per [[Big strategy mid-2022]]
