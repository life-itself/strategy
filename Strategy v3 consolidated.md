This document sets out in one consolidated form Life Itself's current "v3" strategy. It was developed from 2021-2023 and will be published in early 2024.

## Sketch

- Background: the need for evolution of a v2 strategy.
- The rough solution
- The focus and the problem with that: "what kind of pizza are we". How do we find more people "like us" or "like that"?
  - Work on the new brand
  - 3 options
- Where we are today: focus on conscious coliving 
  - But what is our "what"? We are a collective ...
  - What is distinctive is X,Y,Z
  - Why would people want to join?
- The Second Renaissance vision
- How we get there - this is the juicy part
  - Part of answer is we don't know
  - How do new paradigms happen
  - Connecting how to the big picture
  - Research is important ...

## History: v1 in 2017 and v2 in 2020

We have had two previous major versions of our strategy.

- v1: produced "informally" between our founding in 2015 and 2017/2018 
  - See [[Strategy v1 consolidated]]
    - we were not very self-conscious about strategy development in our early years.
- v2: see [[Strategy v2 consolidated]]

## Motivation: Why develop a new iteration of the strategy
